The CPU reads it but whatever the value is, it always clears the flip register. We need to check in the original games. Cocktail mode works on Jack.\r\n- HS/VS timings are certainly wrong.\r\n- Fix OSD options that are not working well: reset & aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nThanks to all my contributors as usual!\r\n",

      "readme": "# Custom Database Template for the MiSTer Downloader\n\nBy following these instructions, you'll create your own [Custom Database for the MiSTer Downloader](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Downloader_MiSTer/blob/main/docs/custom-databases.md). This database can be integrated in MiSTer FPGA by just editing the `downloader.ini` file at the root of the SD.\n\nOnce your database is up, adding files to it is very simple. You'll only have to upload files to your repository on GitHub, and after that, your users will fetch these files directly in their devices, by just running *downloader* or *update_all*.\n\n## How to generate your own Custom Database for the MiSTer Downloader:\n1. Make sure you are logged in into your GitHub account. Or register a new account if you don't have any yet.\n2. Then click on\n    <a style=\"margin-top:100px;\" href=\"https://github.com/theypsilon/DB-Template_MiSTer/generate\">\n        <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Use_this_template-2ea44f\" \n            alt=\"Use this template\"\n            title=\"Create repository from this template\"></a>\nbutton to create your own public Custom Database repository on GitHub.\n3. After less than 5 minutes, you're database file will be generated at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<YOUR GITHUB USER>/<YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY>/db/db.json.zip` (replacing the <> fields accordingly) and will be ready to be used. For example, if your GitHub user is `jose` and your repository name is `game_wallpapers`, the url will be: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jose/game_wallpapers/db/db.json.zip`\n4. To integrate it in a MiSTer device, add the following section to the end of to the file `downloader.ini` that should be placed at the root of the SD (if it doesn't exist, you may create it for this purpose):\n```ini\n[<YOUR GITHUB USER>/<YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY>]\ndb_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<YOUR GITHUB USER>/<YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY>/db/db.json.zip\n```\n5. After that, run *downloader* or *update_all* as usual. It will try to fetch the files from your newly created database. If your database is still empty -which is your case if you followed these instructions-, obviously it won't download any file yet, but it will show up in the logs. For adding files to the database check the next section.\n\n## How to add files to your already working Custom Database:\n\nOnce you have your database up and running (check previous section to figure out how to set it up), adding files is very straightforward.\n\nJust upload any file to your repository by using GitHub UI (Add File > Upload files), or via git. Once the files show up in your repository, they'll also be added to your database automatically. You may see the *Actions* tab in your repository to see how the automation did its magic if you are curious. **NEW:** If you want to add files without uploading them to the repository, you may use the [external_files.csv](external_files.csv) file for that.\n\nA couple of things to consider when uploading files:\n\n- When a user fetches the files via *downloader* or *update_all*, the downloaded file structure will mirror 1:1 the file structure you have in your repository at GitHub. This means, if you have a folder `_Cores/` containing some files in your repository, an identical `_Cores` folder will show up in MiSTer containing the exact same files.\n\n- The files README.md, LICENSE, build_db.py, and the .github folder won't be included in your database. Just ignore them, they won't be installed in the devices.\n\n- You may upload as many files as you want as long as they don't violate GitHub constraints (100mb is max size per file).\n\n- You should avoid full path clashes between your files and the files from other databases so that your users don't run into issues when using multiple databases at the same time.\n\n## How your users will integrate your Custom Database in their MiSTers:\n\nYour users will just have to do the **step 4** of the \"How to generate\" section. So you should add those lines to your documentation replacing the placeholders with the correct GitHub user and repository name.\n\nFor example, assuming GitHub user is \"jose\" and the repository is called \"game_wallpapers\", your users will have to add these lines to the bottom of `downloader.ini`:\n\n```ini\n[jose/game_wallpapers]\ndb_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jose/game_wallpapers/db/db.json.zip\n```\n\nThis needs to be done just once by your users. After that, whenever they run *downloader* or *update_all* they'll also be installing your updated files.\n\n## Modifying README.md\n\nAfter you have your own repository based on this template, a good idea would be to edit your `README.md` describing the content of your database and how to use it. That way users will learn about your Database and will integrate it into their MiSTer's easily.\n\nFeel free to remove any reference to the original template there.\n",

Make sure that there is a .github hidden folder there, if there isn't go back to Step 2, cause something was not copied correctly.\n4. Substitute the contents of the mad folder with files of your own. The folder structure inside mad does not matter, it will just look for files with the .mad extension.\n5. Commit and push the changes.\n6. After 5 mins, your new repository will generate a new branch named db by itself, this is an automatic task. It will contain the zipped json that we need in the [Arcade Organizer](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer/).\n\n## MAD Schema\n\nMAD files are XML files that have to be validated against [this schema](mad_schema.xsd).\n\nAn example of a valid MAD file would be the following:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<misterarcadedescription>\n\n\t<setname>ddonpach</setname>\n\t<name>DoDonPachi (JP)</name>\n\t<region>Japan</region>\n\t<alternative>yes</alternative>\n\t<parent_title>DonPachi</parent_title>\n\t<platform>CAVE 68000</platform>\n\t<series>DonPachi</series>\n\t<homebrew>no</homebrew>\n\t<bootleg>no</bootleg>\n\t<year>1997</year>\n\t<manufacturer>CAVE</manufacturer>\n\t<category>Shooter - Vertical</category>\n\t<best_of>theypsilon Top Shmups|1</best_of>\n\n\t<rotation>vertical (ccw)</rotation>\n\t<flip>yes</flip>\n\t<resolution>15kHz</resolution>\n\n\t<players>2 (simultaneous)</players>\n\t<move_inputs>8-way</move_inputs>\n\t<special_controls></special_controls>\n\t<num_buttons>3</num_buttons>\n\n</misterarcadedescription>\n```\n",

While the name is MiSTer_ArcadeDatabase, it could be used with any application that uses some sort of an organizer script.\n\nAnything missing in the database or have a suggestion?\nCreate an issue ticket. \n\nDon't like the structure of the database and want to use your own MAD database?\nHere is a guide on how to do it: https://github.com/theypsilon/MAD_Database_MiSTer\n\nAuto-Generated json DB file at: \nhttps://github.com/Toryalai1/MiSTer_ArcadeDatabase/tree/db\n\n# Naming convension\nSince it is importaint to know exactly what version of the game you play, I've decided to go for the following naming convension </br> </br> Game Name (Country, Version) [bl/hb]. </br> </br>\nCountry should follow the [Alpha-2](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) country code.\n</br>\nbl means Bootleg\n</br>\nhb means Homebrew\n\n# Prefered version\nAs you might've noticed, there are different versions/clones of the same game. Sometimes the prefered version is documented, and sometimes it is not. The basic rule of thumb is the following (from MAME doc):\n\n```\n- Prefer latest release version\n\n--Prefer English language\n\n- Prefer most widespread release\n\n- Prefer most complete version\n\n- Prefer versions that are uncensored, and have story/cutscenes intact\n\n- Prefer versions that keep the original gameplay balance\n\n- Prefer releases from original developers/publishers rather than licensees\n\n- Prefer releases without region-specific notices or warnings\n```\n\n",

Just wait a couple of minutes in the main menu and SAM will launch a random game from your library. Every few minutes it will randomly select and load a new game. If you like a game that's currently playing, just pick up your controller and push a button, press a key, or move the mouse. SAM will start another game once you return to the main menu. Then the gaming tour begins again!\n\n## Installation\n  \n- The easiest way to install SAM is launch `update_all.sh` menu, select \"Unofficial Scripts\" and select \"Mister SAM files\". After running update_all, you will have a file called `MiSter_SAM_on.sh` in the Scripts folder. Run `MiSter_SAM_on.sh` and wait until SAM is fully installed/updated. You can configure SAM from the menu by running `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` and pushing up.\n  \nor  \n  \n- Copy `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` to your MiSTer's `/media/fat/Scripts` directory\n- From the main MiSTer menu navigate to **Scripts** and select **MiSTer_SAM_on.sh**.\n- **NOTE** Additional files will be downloaded automatically the first time you run `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh`.\n  \n## Offline Installation  \nIf your MiSTer is not connected to the internet, click on \"Code\" -> \"Download Zip\" and download the project package.\n- Copy `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` and `MiSTer_SAM.ini` to `/media/fat/Scripts` on your MiSTer. \n- Additionally copy the entire `.MiSTer_SAM` directory to `/media/fat/Scripts/.MiSTer_SAM` on your MiSTer.\n- To enable autoplay, launch `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` - push up button to enter Menu. Now find enable autoplay in the menu.\n\n## Update  \n- Running `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` will update your existing version to the newest version.\n  \n## Usage\nSimply wait at the main MiSTer menu for 2 minutes (default setting) without touching the mouse, keyboard, or controller and SAM will start.\n\nDon't want to wait? You can start SAM instantly by launching `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` script in your MiSTer's Scripts folder! \n\n## Features\n- **Autoplay** - MiSTer SAM autostarts by default when your MiSTer is idle in the main menu. If you want SAM to always autostart, no matter if in the main menu or not, you can do that by changing \"menuonly\" setting in `MiSTer_SAM.ini` .\n\n- **Controller Detection** - MiSTer SAM will only start when no input has been received from your controllers for the amount of time set in `MiSTer_SAM.ini`  \n\n- **Options Menu** - All options of SAM can be configured from a menu when launching `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh`. Push UP button after launching `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` script. \n**NOTE** The menu does not work out of the box on CRT's . Please try adding the following settings to your `/media/fat/MiSTer.ini` and see if it will make the menu work for your CRT setup:  \n```\n[Menu]\nvideo_mode=640,16,64,80,240,1,3,14,12380\nvga_scaler=1\n```\n  \n- **Exclusion Lists** - You can exclude any amount of games that you don't want to have displayed by adding a file called for example `snes_exclude.txt` in /media/fat/Scripts/.MiSTer_SAM/SAM_Gamelists folder. One line per game, can be full file path or just the game name.\n  \n- **Auto Folder Detection** - No matter if your games are on SD or USB, SAM will find your default game folders.\n  \n- **Curated Blacklists** - The SAM Team is currently recording every game's attract mode to short videos that we capture through HDMi so we can detect if a game is worthy to be shown or should be blacklisted (like Disc 2 for MegaCD, load error FDS games or games with a static screen)\n  \n## Reset to Defaults\nThis process can be used if you want to return MiSTer SAM to default settings or ensure you have the latest files.  \n**Method 1**  \n- Navigate to **Scripts** and select **MiSTer_SAM_on.sh**.  \n- Press **Up Button** to open SAM's menu and select reset.  \n  \n**Method 2**  \n- From the main MiSTer menu open the terminal (F9).\n- Login (default user: `root` default password: `1`).\n- `rm -fr /media/fat/Scripts/.MiSTer_SAM /media/fat/MiSTer_SAM /media/fat/Scripts/MiSTer_SAM.ini`\n- Open the OSD (F12 or your controller's menu button).\n- Navigate to **Scripts** and select **MiSTer_SAM_on.sh**.  \n  \n\n## Configuration\nThe script is highly customizable through the included ini file `MiSTer_SAM.ini` (details below).\n\n## Supported Systems\nCurrently supported MiSTer cores:\n* Amiga (MegaAGS.hdf)\n* AO486 (Drop screensaver vhd's in /media/fat/games/AO486/screensaver - created by flynnsbit)\n* Arcade (all .MRA files)\n* Atari2600/5200/7800 (.a26 .a52 .car .a78)\n* Atari Lynx (.lnx)\n* C64 (.prg and .crt)\n* Famicom Disk System (.fds)\n* Game Boy/ Game Boy Color (.gb and .gbc)   \n* Game Boy Advance (.gba)\n* Genesis (.md .gen)\n* Game Gear (.gg)\n* MegaCD AKA SegaCD (.chd .cue) - Highly recommend `JP Mega-CD 2 (Region Free) 921222 l_oliveira.bin` for best compatibility. Find it in MegaCD folder, google `htgdb-gamepacks`\n* NeoGeo (.neo)\n* NES (.nes)\n* Genesis 32X (.32x)\n* Sega Master System (.sms .sg)\n* SNES (.sfc .smc)\n* PSX (.chd .cue .exe)\n* TurboGrafx-16 AKA PC Engine (.pce .sgx)\n* TurboGrafx-16 CD AKA PC Engine CD (.chd .cue) - No autoboot bios required since SAM will autostart games for you.\n\n## MiSTer Setup\nThe [Update-all](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer) script works great for putting system files in the right places.\n\n## Attract Mode Configuration\n### Arcade Horizontal or Vertical Only\nUncomment one of the \"arcadepath\" settings in the `MiSTer_SAM.ini` file to choose from only horizontal or vertical arcade games.\n\n### Enhanced tty2oled output\n![IMG_1029](https://github.com/mrchrisster/MiSTer_SAM/blob/main/Media/tty2oled-moving.gif)\n\n[tty2oled](https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled/) adds a 3\" OLED screen to your MiSTer! By default, tty2oled displays the current core name. With SAM's enhanced tty2oled support you can see the core and game name!\n\nSimply edit the `MiSTer_SAM.ini` and change the `ttyenable` setting to `ttyenable=\"Yes\"`. If you need to use a non-standard device change it with `ttydevice=\"/dev/ttyUSB0\"`.\n\n### Exclude\nWant to exclude certain arcade games? Just add them to `mraexclude` in the `MiSTer_SAM.ini` file.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How does it work?\nA Linux startup daemon runs in the background of your MiSTer's ARM CPU. It looks for any keyboard activity, mouse movement, or controller button presses via Linux. This is being achieved by monitoring the hardware devices on your MiSTer while using minimal resources - with only native tools (CPU load of >1%). When your MiSTer is displaying the main menu and it's idle for several minutes, SAM will start launching random games.\n\nMiSTer arcade cores are launched via MRA files, all other cores are launched through generating MGL files. \n  \n### Do you support SNAC?  \nSNAC is not handled by the Linux kernel so unfortunately we wont be able to support SNAC devices.\n  \n### I don't like how SAM does something!\nMiSTer SAM is designed to be highly configurable. Please check the `/media/fat/Scripts/MiSTer_SAM.ini` file to see if the behavior you want is configurable. If not, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mrchrisster/MiSTer_SAM/issues/new/choose)! We love feedback and feature requests.\n\n### Will this break my MiSTer? Will attract mode reduce the life of the MiSTer cycling between cores if left on long term?\nShort answer is no. FPGAs [don't have a limited number of writes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxNu_BUL-w). They are solid state devices that are configured at boot up or - in the case of MiSTer - when a core is loaded. There is no wear from this configuration step.\n\nAlso, all files that SAM creates (with the exception of the startup file during first install) are written to RAM mounted storage so you don't need to worry about wearing out your SD card when using SAM.  \n  \n### How do I know what game is on?  \nIf you would like to know what game is currently playing, you can check the file `/tmp/SAM_Game.txt`. Some folks even use this with OBS to automatically change the game name for their Twitch stream!  \n  \n### Where'd this come from? What happened to the other attract mode projects?\nThe great work began with MrChrisster building a MiSTer Attract feature for the NES core. This begat Attract_Arcade after Mellified ~~kept opening issues~~ started helping. Once MrChrisster worked with mbc it unlocked the power to load ROMs for more MiSTer cores, resulting in Attract_Mode. We wanted to bring the project to the next level by automating the process. From this collaboration and passion was born SAM - Super Attract Mode! Since MiSTer SAM does everything the old projects did - and lots more! - we wanted to create a new name appropriate for its new superpowers.\n \n## Troubleshooting\n**- When I try to launch the script, it fails and says something about Document Type**  \nYou most likely didn't download the \"raw\" file.  \nWhen downloading a file from github, click on the file, then click on \"raw\".  \nNow push Ctrl+S to save  \n  \n**- Core is loaded but just hangs on the menu**  \nSometimes this happens (even on our test setups) and it could be for a variety of reasons.   \n- We noticed that some MegaCD games that the script is trying to load also won't work when loaded through the MiSTer interface. \n- Make sure you are using the recommended folder structure, such as /media/fat/Games/SNES/. \n- The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders. For MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD games must be in CHD format.  \n \nIf you are still having trouble it could simply be that the rom failed to load, it seems to happen every now and then.  \n  \n**- Turbografx16 CD and MegaCD just showing Run/Start button but not starting into the game**  \nIf SAM's auto start feature fails for whatever reason, you can try and use a bios that auto launches the game.  \n\n**- Can I use a CIFS mount for my games?**  \nCIFS is supported.\nHere is an example of some values in `cifs_mount.sh` that should get you started. \nThe idea is to mount The SMB `Games` folder over the MiSTer SD card `Games` folder:\n  \n```\nSERVER=\"192.168.1.10\"  \nSHARE=\"Games/Mister/Games\"  \nLOCAL_DIR=\"*\"  \nBASE_PATH=\"/media/fat/Games\" \n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\nFor technical users here are a few handy tricks to observe and debug SAM.\n\n- To enable more console messages: `samdebug=\"Yes\"`\n- Check the generated MGL file under `/tmp/SAM_game.mgl`. \n\n## SSH features  \n\nSome commands to control SAM from the command line  \n  \n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh monitor` - This will attach MiSTer SAM to current shell (only works while autoplay is running)\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh start` - Start SAM immediately\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh skip | next` - Load next game - doesn't interrupt loop if running\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh stop` - Stop SAM immediately\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh update` - Update SAM\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh enable` - Enable SAM autoplay mode\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh disable` - Disable SAM autoplay\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh reset` - Reset SAM\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh arcade | psx | genesis | s32x | etc...` - Only launch specific system\n- `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh favorite` - Copy the current game to \"_Favorites\" folder\n   \n   \n## Release History\n- 02 Feb 2023 - ao486 integration, Kids Safe Mode, Dynamically finding new roms, Adjust global volume for BGM\n- 10 Aug 2022 - tty2oled and gamelist updates. Default blacklists now filter out bring attract screens\n- 24 Jun 2022 - Added category exclusion mode, atari core support and BGM support\n- 25 Apr 2022 - Added gb,gbc,gg and s32x support.

Downloads most essential files, including cores and firmware. You are able to select between two versions:\n    * The [official MiSTer Distribution](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Distribution_MiSTer) in the [MiSTer-devel](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel) organization. **[Default option]**\n    * The [DB9 Fork MiSTer Distribution](https://github.com/MiSTer-DB9/Distribution_MiSTer) with [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers. *Requires [SNAC8](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#snac8) compatible adapter.*\n2. __JTCORES for MiSTer__. Downloads many cores made by [Jotego](https://github.com/jotego). You may select between two versions:\n    * [jtcores](https://github.com/jotego/jtcores_mister). Public cores only. **[Default option]**\n    * [jtpremium](https://github.com/jotego/jtpremium). Public + patreon-only cores in their latest versions.\n3. [Names TXT](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer). Downloads a complete names.txt file curated by [Threepwood](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush) that enables better core names in the menus. **[Disabled by default]**\n4. [BIOS Database](https://github.com/theypsilon/BiosDB_MiSTer). Downloads bios from https://archive.org/ for your installed systems. **[Disabled by default]**\n5. [Arcade ROMs Database](https://github.com/theypsilon/ArcadeROMsDB_MiSTer). Downloads arcade roms from https://archive.org/ that are compatible with MRAs. **[Disabled by default]**\n6. **Unofficial Cores**. A selection of curated databases that provide unofficial cores, including:\n   1. [Coin-Op Collection](https://github.com/atrac17/Coin-Op_Collection). Downloads cores developed by [Darren](https://github.com/va7deo) and [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17). **[Default option]**\n   2. [Arcade Offset](https://github.com/atrac17/Arcade_Offset). Downloads patched arcade games curated by [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17). **[Disabled by default]**\n   3. [LLAPI Forks Folder](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/LLAPI_folder_MiSTer). Downloads [LLAPI cores](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer/wiki) which are compatible with BlisSTer and [LLAMA](https://github.com/bootsector/LLAMA). **[Disabled by default]**\n8. **Unofficial Scripts**. A selection of curated databases that provide unofficial scripts.  **[Disabled by default]**\n\n\nAdditionally, this script also runs the [Arcade Organizer](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer). Which creates a folder structure under `_Arcade/_Organized` for easy navigation to all the MRA files.\n\n\n## Setup\n\nDownload this [ZIP file](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/releases/latest/download/update_all.zip) and extract `update_all.sh` to your `/Scripts` folder on your primary SD card.\n\nThen turn on your __MiSTer__, go to the _Scripts_ menu and run this script from there.\n\nIt will take around 15 minutes the first time you run it, but later runs should take much less time.\n\n\n## Further Configuration\n\nIn case you would like to configure Update All so it downloads exactly what you need, you can do it through the Settings screen.\n\n![settings screen](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/menu-2-0.jpeg \"Settings Screen\")\n\nThe Settings screen will show up if you press UP in your controller or keyboard during the countdown showing up right after starting `update_all.sh` in your MiSTer. Please, don't forget to select `SAVE` to keep all the changes you have done before leaving.\n\n\n\n## PC Launcher (for Windows, Mac, and Linux)\n\nCheck [MiSTer Downloader's PC Launcher](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Downloader_MiSTer/blob/main/docs/pc-launcher.md) to download all MiSTer files on your PC.\nUseful if you can't connect your MiSTer to the internet.\n\nTo install the same files that you get with Update All, use the same `downloader.ini` file that you have in your MiSTer at the root of the SD card. Keep in mind that Update All writes into that file every time you change something in the Settings Screen.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nConsider funding [Alexey Melnikov \"Sorgelig\"](https://www.patreon.com/FPGAMiSTer) for his invaluable work on the [MiSTer project](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki).\n\nCheck also other core developers that you might want to support:\n* [Sergey Dvodnenko \"srg320\"](https://www.patreon.com/srg320)\n* [Jos\u00e9 Tejada \"jotego\"](https://www.patreon.com/jotego)\n* [Robert Peip \"FPGAzumSpass\"](https://www.patreon.com/FPGAzumSpass)\n* [Josh Bassett \"nullobject\"](https://www.patreon.com/nullobject)\n* [MiSTer-X](https://www.patreon.com/MrX_8B)\n* [furrtek](https://www.patreon.com/furrtek)\n* [Ace](https://ko-fi.com/ace9921)\n* [Blackwine](https://www.patreon.com/blackwine)\n* [atrac17](https://www.patreon.com/atrac17)\n* [Darren](https://ko-fi.com/darreno)\n\nAnd finally, if you would like to support my work, you may also subscribe to my patreon here:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=37499475\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2b7105015397da52617ce6775a339b0b99d689d6f644c2ce911c5d472362bcbd/68747470733a2f2f63352e70617472656f6e2e636f6d2f65787465726e616c2f6c6f676f2f6265636f6d655f615f706174726f6e5f627574746f6e2e706e67\"></img></a>\n\n\n\n## Supporters+ shout-out!\n\nDaniel Tarsky, James D Eberhart, Koala Koa, MiSTerFPGA.co.uk, Tony Escobar, turbochop3300 and Wayne Booker\n\nThank you so much for supporting this project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=37499475)!
