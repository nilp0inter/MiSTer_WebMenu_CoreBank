      "readme": "# Acorn Archimedes for [MiSTer Board](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)\r\n\r\n### This is the port of [Archie](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/tree/master/cores/archie) core from MiST by Stephen Leary\r\n\r\n**CURRENTLY THIS CORE IS IN BETA STATUS**\r\n\r\n1. Basic internals are implemented.\r\n1. Basic Floppy disk support\r\n1. Sound support added but may not work in all situations.\r\n1. The core emulates a 4Mb A3000 type machine with an ARM2a with caches disabled for now (has an A3010 style joystick interface).\r\n1. Core runs at ~91% of an ARM2 @ 8Mhz when using VGA Modes.\r\n1. Some games now run. Expect issues.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCopy the [*.rbf](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Archie_MiSTer/tree/master/releases) into a root folder of the SD card.\r\nCopy a version of a RiscOS ROM into the \"Archie\" folder, renaming it to `riscos.rom`.\r\n\r\n### Floppy disk images\r\n\r\nThe current version supports two floppy drives. Floppy disk images ADF format and of exactly 819200 bytes in size are currently required. This is the most common format for the Acorn Archimedes.\r\n\r\nImages named `floppy0.adf` and `floppy1.adf` (from Archie folder) are auto-inserted into the floppy disk drives on startup. Other images can be selected via the on-screen-display (OSD) which can be opened using the **WIN+F12** key combo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## OSD Menu\r\n\r\nIf the ROM is recognized the core should boot into Risc OS.\r\nPress **Win+F12** to open the OSD menu.\r\n\r\n* Floppy 0: Choose the floppy disk images to use for floppy 0\r\n* Floppy 1: Choose the floppy disk images to use for floppy 1\r\n* OS ROM: Choose the RISCOS rom to use\r\n* Save config: Save current config for next boot\r\n\r\nYou can move to other pages of settings by pressing the right arrow key.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* CPU module (amber23) has no reset signal, so the only way to reset the core is to reload it. MiSTer will help to reload the core if **USER** button is pressed (or reset combo pressed on keyboard) and core file is named as **\"Archie.rbf\"**. Otherwise you can reload the core manually from menu (**Win+Alt+F12**).\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis core uses the Amber CPU core from OpenCores which is LGPL.\r\nThe core itself is dual licensed LGPL/BSD.\r\n",

This script will not clobber any files you already have. You need to manually remove any BIOS files you have if you want to download new BIOS files for the core.\n\n**Q:** Where are the Downloaded BIOS files located?\n\n**A:** This script downloads all bios files to /media/fat/BIOS.\n\n**Q:** Can I set a custom BIOS directory location?\n\n**A:** Yes, in the update_bios-getter.ini: BIOSDIR=/path/to/your/location\n\n**Q:** Can I set this to work with usb drives?\n\n**A:** Yes, this script will automatically recognize all the directories the same way the MiSTer binary would do\n\nThe bios-getter will download many bios files to /media/fat/BIOS. However, we have chosen some sane defaults to be copied to the /games/<console> directory. These defaults are:\n  \n  Astrocade\n  ```\n  Bally Professional Arcade, Astrocade '3159' BIOS (1978)(Bally Mfg. Corp.).bin\n  ```\n  \n  Gameboy\n  ```\n  GB_boot_ROM.gb\n  ```\n\n  GBA\n  ```\n  gba_bios.bin\n  ```\n\n  MegaCD    \n  ```\n  [BIOS] Mega-CD 2 (Japan) (v2.00C).md\" \"Japan\"\n  [BIOS] Sega CD 2 (USA) (v2.00).md\" \"USA\"\n  [BIOS] Mega-CD 2 (Europe) (v2.00).md\" \"Europe\"\n ```\n \n NeoGeo     \n ```\n 000-lo.lo\n sfix.sfix\n uni-bios-40\n ```\n \n NES\n ```\n fds-bios.rom\n ```\n \n TGFX16-CD\n ```\n Super CD 3.0.pce\n ```\n\n**You should back up your bios files before running this script.**\n\nUSE AT YOUR OWN RISK - THIS COMES WITHOUT WARRANTY AND MAY KILL BABY SEALS.\n",

If you feel uncomfortable, for security reasons, with a script which downloads and executes another script from the Internet, you can directly download and use [mister_updater.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/mister_updater.sh?raw=true) and it will work the same, all ini file considerations will still be valid, but you will have to update the script manually.<br>\nYou can have many differently named copies of [update_unofficials.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/update_unofficials.sh?raw=true) (or [mister_updater.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/mister_updater.sh?raw=true) if you prefer) and its ini file, for different updating behaviours i.e.:<br>\n- you can make an *update_arcade.sh* with its *[update_arcade.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_arcade.ini?raw=true)* using these settings (simply copy this code in an empty text file named *update_arcade.ini* and put it in the same directory as *update_arcade.sh*):\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"arcade-cores\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES=( )\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_commodore.sh* with its *[update_commodore.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_commodore.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"PET2001 VIC20 C64 C16 Minimig\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES=( )\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_additional_repositories.sh* with its *[update_additional_repositories.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_additional_repositories.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"ZZZZZZZZZ\"\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_fonts.sh* with its *[update_fonts.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_fonts.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"ZZZZZZZZZ\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES=( \"https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Fonts_MiSTer|pf|$BASE_PATH/font\" )\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_linux.sh* with its *[update_linux.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_linux.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"ZZZZZZZZZ\"\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"true\"\n```\n- you can make an update_all.sh with its [update_all.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_all.ini?raw=true) using these settings:\n```\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"true\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"true\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES+=( \"https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Fonts_MiSTer|pf|$BASE_PATH/font\" )\n\n```\nI take no responsibility for any data loss or anything, if your DE10-Nano catches fire it\u2019s up to you: **use the script at your own risk**.\n",

Downloads most of cores and firmware. You are able to select between these two options:\n    * [Official Main MiSTer Updater](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer) maintained by [Locutus73](https://github.com/Locutus73) in the [MiSTer-devel](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel) organization.\n    * [DB9 Fork Main MiSTer Updater](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_DB9) with [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers. Requires [SNAC8](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#snac8) compatible adapter.\n2. [Jotego Cores Updater](https://github.com/jotego/Updater_script_MiSTer). Downloads many advanced cores made by [Jotego](https://github.com/jotego).\n3. [Unofficial Cores Updater](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial). Downloads [some cores](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/wiki) that are not yet released but are fairly stable. Disabled by default.\n4. [LLAPI Cores Updater](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer). Downloads [LLAPI cores](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer/wiki) which are compatible with BlisSTer and [LLAMA](https://github.com/bootsector/LLAMA). Disabled by default.\n5. [BIOS Getter](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_BIOS_SCRIPTS) download bios for your installed systems from https://archive.org/\n6. [MAME and HBMAME Getter](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_MAME_SCRIPTS) download roms from https://archive.org/\n7. [Names TXT Updater](https://github.com/theypsilon/Names_TXT_Updater_MiSTer). Downloads a community curated names.txt file that enables better core names in the menus.\n8. [Arcade Organizer](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/_arcade-organizer). Creates a folder structure under `_Arcade/_Organized` for easy navigation to all the MRA files.\n\nThis script also contains some snippets from the __Updater script__ maintained by [Locutus73](https://github.com/Locutus73).\n\n__BIOS__, __MAME__ and __HBMAME Getters__ and __Arcade Organizer__ scripts are maintained by [amoore2600](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IynEJIMqkYaCVjEk_EIlg).\n\n\n\n## Setup\n\nDownload this [ZIP file](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/update_all.zip) and extract `update_all.sh` to your `/Scripts` folder on your primary SD card.\n\nThen turn on your __MiSTer__, go to the _Scripts_ menu and run this script from there.\n\nIt will take around 30 minutes the first time you run it, but later runs should take much less time.\n\n\n\n## Alternative Setups\n\nOther setups that might be useful for you:\n- [DB9/SNAC8 ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/update_all_db9_snac8.zip): Enables [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers.\n- [usb0 ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/update_all_usb0.zip): For people using USB as primary storage. You will be able to run this script from there and install all cores, roms, and MRAs on `/media/usb0`.\n\n\nNOTE: You should extract also all the INI files contained in these.\n\n\n\n## MiSTer Offline Setup\n\nCheck [updater-pc](./updater-pc) to download all the MiSTer files from your PC.\n\nUseful if you can't connect your MiSTer to internet.\n\n\n\n## Further Configuration\n\nIn case you would like to configure Update All so it downloads exactly what you need, you can do it through the Settings screen.\n\n![settings screen](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/f66d6ba9-91e1-4581-82a2-c51f7f5424d5.jpeg \"Settings Screen\")\n\nThe Settings screen will show up if you press UP in your controller or keyboard during the countdown showing up right after starting `update_all.sh` in your MiSTer. Please, don't forget to select `SAVE` to keep all the changes you have done before leaving.\n\n## Optimizations\n\nThe __MAME__ and __HBMAME Getters__ are skipped if no new MRA are detected in the device.\n\nIf there are new MRAs that contains MAME roms, __MAME Getter__ will be executed if enabled.\n\nIf there are new MRAs that contains HBMAME roms, __HBMAME Getter__ will be executed if enabled.\n\n__Arcade Organizer__ is also skipped if there isn't any new MRA.\n\n## Funding\n\nConsider funding [Alexey Melnikov \"Sorgelig\"](https://www.patreon.com/FPGAMiSTer) for his invaluable work on the [MiSTer project](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki).\n\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, [Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso Galindo](https://github.com/theypsilon).\nReleased under the [GPL v3 License](LICENSE).\n\n\n\n## Warning\n\nI take no responsibility for any data loss or any damage you may incur because of the usage of this script.\n\nPlease check the README.md of the scripts being called by Update All:\n\nhttps://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_DB9<br>\nhttps://github.com/jotego/Updater_script_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial<br>\nhttps://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_MAME_SCRIPTS<br>\nhttps://github.com/MAME-GETTER/_arcade-organizer<br>\n",
