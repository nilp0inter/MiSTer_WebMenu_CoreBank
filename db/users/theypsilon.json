      "readme": "# ao486 port for MiSTer by Sorgelig.\n\nCore was greatly reworked with many new features and performance added.\n\n## Features:\n* 486DX33 performance (no-FPU).\n* 256MB RAM\n* SVGA with up to 1280x1024@256, 1024x768@64K, 640x480@16M resolutions\n* Sound Blaster 16 (DSP v4.05) and Sound Blaster Pro (DSP v3.02) with OPL3 and C/MS\n* High speed UART (3Mbps) internet connection\n* MIDI port (dumb and fake-smart modes)\n* Extrnal MIDI device support (MT32-pi and generic MIDI)\n* 4 HDDs with up to 137GB each\n* 2 CD-ROMs\n* Shared folder support\n\n## How to install\n\n* Copy ao486.rbf to root of SD card\n* Create /ao486 directory on SD card and copy [boot0.rom](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ao486_MiSTer/blob/master/releases/bios/boot0.rom?raw=true), [boot1.rom](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ao486_MiSTer/blob/master/releases/bios/boot1.rom?raw=true) there.\n* For floppy: copy desired floppy raw image with extension **img** to ao486 directory.\n* For HDD: create an empty file of desired size with extension **vhd** in ao486 directory (or prepare .vhd file separately with any tool supporting .vhd or hard disk .img files and copy to /ao486 folder)\n* Boot ao486 and in OSD choose desired floppy, hdd and boot order\n* Save settings and press \"Reset and apply HDD\"\n\nHDD image is a raw image with MBR. It can be opened in Windows/Linux by many applications,\nso it's possible to prepare a HDD in windows/linux (in most cases you need to work with .img files, then just rename it to .vhd extension)\n\n### Sound Blaster\nDefault config: A220 I5 D1 H5 T6\nSupported alternative configs with IRQ 7 or 10 and/or no-HDMA (16bit DMA through 8bit DMA).\nStandard SB16 config (diagnose) can be used to set alternative settings, or included sbctl util. Windows driver manages alternative settings by itself when manually configured.\n\nCurrent implementation supports SoundBlaster Pro specific commands (not available in SB16 originally) as well. Compatible config for SBPro is \"A220 I5 D1 T4\" in case if some game will require it.\n\nASP/CSP is not implemented, but some specific commands with dummy replies are added to let Windows driver work.\n\nSimple volume (only master volume) is implemented in mixer so windows volume can be used in additional to standard MiSTer volume control.\n\n### C/MS Audio\nC/MS (dual SAA1099) can be enabled in OSD. When enabled it prevents OPL2/3 access on ports 220-223. OPL2/3 still can be accessed on ports 388-38B (AdLib).\n\n### OPL2/3 (Adlib)\nOPL2/3 can be accessed as a part of Sound Blaster board at ports 220-223 (if C/MS is not enabled) and 228-229(OPL2 only). However it's recommended to use AdLib ports 388-38B instead.\n\n### MIDI settings:\n* address: 330h\n* IRQ: 9\n\n### MT32-pi support:\n[MT32-pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi) connection is supported through USER I/O port. MT32-pi is automatically detected.\nSupported straight and crossed RX<->TX cables.\n\nMT32-pi config and settings are [here](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/MiSTer-FPGA-user-port-connection).\n\nMT32-pi interface board is on [Hardware repository](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Hardware_MiSTer)\n\nLCD and buttons are for convenience but not required. Basically only USER I/O connector is required, so it can be assembled without interface board.\n\n### Drivers\nWindows 9x drivers for video and modem are [here](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ao486_MiSTer/blob/master/releases/drv)\n\n### Note:\n* Press **WIN+F12** to access **OSD on ao486 core**. F12 alone acts as generic F12 PC key.\n\n### CD-ROM\nCurrently only data portion of CD is supported. Best image format is ISO, but BIN/CUE format still can be mounted. You just need to mount bin file or if it's multi-file image, then usually first track is data which you need to mount.\n\nIDE 1-0 has special function - it's a placeholder for CD. So you can hot-swap CD images in this drive. Regardless special function this drive also supports HDD images. Once HDD image is loaded upon reboot this drive loses CD placeholder feature.\n\n### Hard Disk and CD-ROM in Windows\nCore supports up to 4 HDD images up to 137GB each. Up to 2 CD-ROMs are supported.\n\nCurrently due to unknown source of issue Windows works with IDE devices through BIOS. Most likely some BIOS function doesn't supply correct info for Windows drivers.\nIt doesn't prevent windows from working but you need to keep in mind some specifics:\n* Hard disks mounted on Primary IDE (0-0/0-1) need no attentions. They simply work.\n* Driver for Secondary IDE (1-0/1-1) have yellow mark. It's recommended to delete this device from device list - it's not used anyway but will be installed every time you start automatic HW detection procedure.\n* CD-ROM needs oakcdrom.sys and mscdex.exe added to config.sys and autoexec.bat respectively (you may find them on bootable Window98 CD). Windows will use it to access CD-ROM.\n* CD-ROM autostart won't be automatically triggered (because work through BIOS). After replacing image file in CD-ROM you need to refresh the folder with drives (F5) and icon of CD will be changed if provided by image. Autostart will be triggered when you click on CD icon.\n\nOriginal core [repository](https://github.com/alfikpl/ao486)\n",

Basic internals are implemented.\r\n1. Basic Floppy disk support\r\n1. Sound support added but may not work in all situations.\r\n1. The core emulates a 4Mb A3000 type machine with an ARM2a with caches disabled for now (has an A3010 style joystick interface).\r\n1. Core runs at ~91% of an ARM2 @ 8Mhz when using VGA Modes.\r\n1. Some games now run. Expect issues.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCopy the [*.rbf](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Archie_MiSTer/tree/master/releases) into a root folder of the SD card.\r\nCopy a version of a RiscOS ROM into the \"Archie\" folder, renaming it to `riscos.rom`.\r\n\r\n### Floppy disk images\r\n\r\nThe current version supports two floppy drives. Floppy disk images ADF format and of exactly 819200 bytes in size are currently required. This is the most common format for the Acorn Archimedes.\r\n\r\nImages named `floppy0.adf` and `floppy1.adf` (from Archie folder) are auto-inserted into the floppy disk drives on startup. Other images can be selected via the on-screen-display (OSD) which can be opened using the **WIN+F12** key combo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## OSD Menu\r\n\r\nIf the ROM is recognized the core should boot into Risc OS.\r\nPress **Win+F12** to open the OSD menu.\r\n\r\n* Floppy 0: Choose the floppy disk images to use for floppy 0\r\n* Floppy 1: Choose the floppy disk images to use for floppy 1\r\n* OS ROM: Choose the RISCOS rom to use\r\n* Save config: Save current config for next boot\r\n\r\nYou can move to other pages of settings by pressing the right arrow key.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* CPU module (amber23) has no reset signal, so the only way to reset the core is to reload it. MiSTer will help to reload the core if **USER** button is pressed (or reset combo pressed on keyboard) and core file is named as **\"Archie.rbf\"**. Otherwise you can reload the core manually from menu (**Win+Alt+F12**).\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis core uses the Amber CPU core from OpenCores which is LGPL.\r\nThe core itself is dual licensed LGPL/BSD.\r\n",

      "readme": "# Names_MiSTer\n\nThe names.txt-files provide proper system names in the OSD (main menu) of MiSTer FPGA. The aim is to build name-files for different regions, with different system name lengths and ways of sorting. The files can be pulled via updater scripts, or used as a base for a custom names.txt.\n\nBy default MiSTer displays the filenames of the individual core files (*.rbf). If a names.txt is present in the root of the microSD and only if a core name is matched, then the name is substituted in the way of '[rbf-filename]: [substitute name]', e.g. 'Minimig: Commodore Amiga'.\n\nIf a new core is installed via updater, that does not have a substitute name in the names.txt yet, then it will appear in the list of systems with its rbf-filename. The other cores that have a match in names.txt will still be represented by their substitute names.\n\n## Quickstart\n1. Download the file with the desired region, sorting and maximum name length (18, 28 or full)\n2. Rename the file to \"names.txt\"\n3. Copy the names.txt to the root of the MiSTer micro SD (same location as MiSTer.ini)\n4. [Optional] In MiSTer.ini set 'rbf_hide_datecode=1' to disable Date codes of cores in the MiSTer main menu (F2 toggles the display of Date Codes). This allows up to 28 characters to be displayed without scrolling.\n\n## Syntax\nThe filenames are made up from \"names_[CHAR18 or CHAR28 or FULL]_[sorting]_[country/continent].txt\" and must be renamed to \"names.txt\" to be used.\n\n### Char Code\n* CHAR18: Maximum system name length is 18 characters to fit without scrolling when Date Codes are ON.\n* CHAR28: Maximum system name length is 28 characters to fit without scrolling when Date Codes are OFF.\n* CHAR54: Maximum system name length is 54 characters to fit two lines without scrolling when Date Codes are OFF.\n\n### Sort Code\n* Manufacturer: Will prepend the system name with a manufacturer name to group them by manufacturer where available.\n* Common: This variant uses commonly used names for systems, like only \"Amiga\" for the Commodore Amiga, but \"Commodore 64\" for said system. These variants are often shorter while still being instantly recognizable.\n\n### Country / Continent\nISO 3166-1 alpha-2 Codes and Country Codes, like JP, US, EU, are used to append a region code to files that contain region specific naming of systems.\n\n## How to contribute\nPull requests are welcome. When making a pull request, please try to provide a source for the validity of the change or addition.",

Versions for other regions are available too.\n\n\n\nThe downloaded `names.txt` files are curated in the following repository:  \n[github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer)\n\nContribute there to improve the naming and the available options.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Threepwood](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush) for his work maintaining that repository and curating its files.\n\n\n\n## Warning\n\nThis script will overwrite your current `names.txt` file if you have one already!\n\n\n\n## Setup\n\nDownload this [ZIP file](https://github.com/theypsilon/Names_TXT_Updater_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/names-txt_US.zip) and extract `update_names-txt.sh` to your `/Scripts` folder on your primary SD card.\n\nThen turn on your __MiSTer__, go to the _Scripts_ menu and run this script from there.\n\n\n\n## Alternative Setups\n\nOther setups that might be useful for you:\n- [EU](https://github.com/theypsilon/Names_TXT_Updater_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/names-txt_EU.zip): European names.\n- [JP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Names_TXT_Updater_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/names-txt_JP.zip): Japanese names.\n\nNOTE: You should extract also `update_names-txt.ini` in these.\n\n\n\n# Arcade Organizer\n\nThe `names.txt` files are also readed by the Arcade Organizer when generating the Cores folder.\n\n![](setups/arcade_organizer.gif)\n\nHere is the result of applying this updater and then the [Arcade Organizer](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/_arcade-organizer).\n\n\n\n## Further Configuration\n\nIn case you would like to modify options by hand, you can create a `update_names-txt.ini` file sitting next to where you have placed `update_names-txt.sh`.\n\nYou may change the following parameters:\n\n```bash\n# Sets the downloaded `names.txt` Region Code to \"US\", \"EU\" or \"JP\"\nNAMES_REGION=\"US\"\n# Sets the downloaded `names.txt` Char Code to \"CHAR18\" or \"CHAR28\"\nNAMES_CHAR_CODE=\"CHAR18\"\n# Sets the downloaded `names.txt` Sort Code to \"Manufacturer\" or \"Common\"\nNAMES_SORT_CODE=\"Common\"\n\n# \"false\" to not reboot automatically after a system component has been updated.\n# System component here means menu.rbf, MiSTer binary, Linux, and such.\nAUTOREBOOT=\"true\"\n\n###########################\n# Troubleshooting Options #\n###########################\n\n# Network resilience parameters\nCURL_RETRY=\"--connect-timeout 15 --max-time 240 --retry 3 --retry-delay 5 --silent --show-error\"\nALLOW_INSECURE_SSL=\"true\"\n```\n\nIn order to understand better the implications of the `NAMES_*` options, please read all the explanations from this repository:\n[github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer)\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nConsider funding [Alexey Melnikov \"Sorgelig\"](https://www.patreon.com/FPGAMiSTer) for his invaluable work on the [MiSTer project](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki).\n\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, [Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso Galindo](https://twitter.com/josembarroso).\nReleased under the [GPL v3 License](LICENSE).\n",

You can make an update_unofficials.ini (same name as the script and placed in the same directory) file with custom user options: see [mister_updater.sh USER OPTIONS section](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/5c7968cca525adc53b8690c8f762ab49cd2e852e/mister_updater.sh#L89-L205) (please click the link) for all user options and their detailed explanations. If you feel uncomfortable, for security reasons, with a script which downloads and executes another script from the Internet, you can directly download and use [mister_updater.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/mister_updater.sh?raw=true) and it will work the same, all ini file considerations will still be valid, but you will have to update the script manually.<br>\nYou can have many differently named copies of [update_unofficials.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/update_unofficials.sh?raw=true) (or [mister_updater.sh](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/mister_updater.sh?raw=true) if you prefer) and its ini file, for different updating behaviours i.e.:<br>\n- you can make an *update_arcade.sh* with its *[update_arcade.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_arcade.ini?raw=true)* using these settings (simply copy this code in an empty text file named *update_arcade.ini* and put it in the same directory as *update_arcade.sh*):\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"arcade-cores\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES=( )\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_commodore.sh* with its *[update_commodore.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_commodore.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"PET2001 VIC20 C64 C16 Minimig\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES=( )\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_additional_repositories.sh* with its *[update_additional_repositories.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_additional_repositories.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"ZZZZZZZZZ\"\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_fonts.sh* with its *[update_fonts.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_fonts.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"ZZZZZZZZZ\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES=( \"https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Fonts_MiSTer|pf|$BASE_PATH/font\" )\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"false\"\n```\n- you can make an *update_linux.sh* with its *[update_linux.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_linux.ini?raw=true)* using these settings:\n```\nREPOSITORIES_FILTER=\"ZZZZZZZZZ\"\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"false\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"true\"\n```\n- you can make an update_all.sh with its [update_all.ini](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/blob/master/examples/update_all.ini?raw=true) using these settings:\n```\nUPDATE_CHEATS=\"true\"\nUPDATE_LINUX=\"true\"\nADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES+=( \"https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Fonts_MiSTer|pf|$BASE_PATH/font\" )\n\n```\nI take no responsibility for any data loss or anything, if your DE10-Nano catches fire it\u2019s up to you: **use the script at your own risk**.\n",

Downloads most of cores and firmware. You are able to select between these two options:\n    * [Official Main MiSTer Updater](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer) maintained by [Locutus73](https://github.com/Locutus73) in the [MiSTer-devel](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel) organization.\n    * [DB9 Fork Main MiSTer Updater](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_DB9) with [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers. Requires [SNAC8](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#snac8) compatible adapter.\n2. [Jotego Cores Updater](https://github.com/jotego/Updater_script_MiSTer). Downloads many advanced cores made by [Jotego](https://github.com/jotego).\n3. [Unofficial Cores Updater](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial). Downloads [some cores](https://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial/wiki) that are not yet released but are fairly stable. Disabled by default.\n4. [LLAPI Cores Updater](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer). Downloads [LLAPI cores](https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer/wiki) which are compatible with BlisSTer and [LLAMA](https://github.com/bootsector/LLAMA). Disabled by default.\n5. [BIOS Getter](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_BIOS_SCRIPTS) download bios for your installed systems from https://archive.org/\n6. [MAME and HBMAME Getter](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_MAME_SCRIPTS) download roms from https://archive.org/\n7. [Names TXT Updater](https://github.com/theypsilon/Names_TXT_Updater_MiSTer). Downloads a community curated names.txt file that enables better core names in the menus.\n8. [Arcade Organizer](https://github.com/MAME-GETTER/_arcade-organizer). Creates a folder structure under `_Arcade/_Organized` for easy navigation to all the MRA files.\n\nThis script also contains some snippets from the __Updater script__ maintained by [Locutus73](https://github.com/Locutus73).\n\n__BIOS__, __MAME__ and __HBMAME Getters__ and __Arcade Organizer__ scripts are maintained by [amoore2600](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IynEJIMqkYaCVjEk_EIlg).\n\n\n\n## Setup\n\nDownload this [ZIP file](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/update_all.zip) and extract `update_all.sh` to your `/Scripts` folder on your primary SD card.\n\nThen turn on your __MiSTer__, go to the _Scripts_ menu and run this script from there.\n\nIt will take around 30 minutes the first time you run it, but later runs should take much less time.\n\n\n\n## Alternative Setups\n\nOther setups that might be useful for you:\n- [DB9/SNAC8 ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/update_all_db9_snac8.zip): Enables [Extended Native Controller Compatibility](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/wiki#extended-native-controller-compatibility) for Genesis and NeoGeo/Supergun controllers.\n- [usb0 ZIP](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/update_all_usb0.zip): For people using USB as primary storage. You will be able to run this script from there and install all cores, roms, and MRAs on `/media/usb0`.\n\n\nNOTE: You should extract also all the INI files contained in these.\n\n\n\n## MiSTer Offline Setup\n\nCheck [updater-pc](./updater-pc) to download all the MiSTer files from your PC.\n\nUseful if you can't connect your MiSTer to internet.\n\n\n\n## Further Configuration\n\nIn case you would like to configure Update All so it downloads exactly what you need, you can do it through the Settings screen.\n\n![settings screen](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/raw/master/setups/f66d6ba9-91e1-4581-82a2-c51f7f5424d5.jpeg \"Settings Screen\")\n\nThe Settings screen will show up if you press UP in your controller or keyboard during the countdown showing up right after starting `update_all.sh` in your MiSTer. Please, don't forget to select `SAVE` to keep all the changes you have done before leaving.\n\n## Optimizations\n\nThe __MAME__ and __HBMAME Getters__ are skipped if no new MRA are detected in the device.\n\nIf there are new MRAs that contains MAME roms, __MAME Getter__ will be executed if enabled.\n\nIf there are new MRAs that contains HBMAME roms, __HBMAME Getter__ will be executed if enabled.\n\n__Arcade Organizer__ is also skipped if there isn't any new MRA.\n\n## Funding\n\nConsider funding [Alexey Melnikov \"Sorgelig\"](https://www.patreon.com/FPGAMiSTer) for his invaluable work on the [MiSTer project](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki).\n\nCheck also other core developers that you might want to support:\n* [Sergey Dvodnenko \"srg320\"](https://www.patreon.com/srg320)\n* [Jos\u00e9 Tejada \"jotego\"](https://www.patreon.com/topapate)\n* [Josh Bassett \"nullobject\"](https://www.patreon.com/nullobject)\n* [MiSTer-X](https://www.patreon.com/MrX_8B)\n* [furrtek](https://www.patreon.com/furrtek)\n* [FPGA PSX Project](https://www.patreon.com/laxer3a)\n\nAnd finally, if you would like to support my work, you may tip me here:\n\n<a href='https://ko-fi.com/theypsilon' target='_blank'><img height='35' style='border:0px;height:46px;' src='https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi3.png?v=0' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' />\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, [Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso Galindo](https://twitter.com/josembarroso). \nReleased under the [GPL v3 License](LICENSE).\n\n\n\n## Warning\n\nI take no responsibility for any data loss or any damage you may incur because of the usage of this script.\n\nPlease check the README.md of the scripts being called by Update All:\n\nhttps://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/MiSTer-DB9/Updater_script_MiSTer_DB9<br>\nhttps://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI/Updater_script_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/jotego/Updater_script_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/theypsilon/Updater_script_MiSTer_Unofficial<br>\nhttps://github.com/theypsilon/Names_TXT_Updater_MiSTer<br>\nhttps://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_MAME_SCRIPTS<br>\nhttps://github.com/MAME-GETTER/_arcade-organizer<br>\nhttps://github.com/MAME-GETTER/MiSTer_BIOS_SCRIPTS<br>\n",
