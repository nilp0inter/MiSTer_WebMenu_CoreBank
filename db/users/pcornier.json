It's a reproduction of the original PCBs with the following exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I removed D2 to D4 multiplexers because FG POS/ID registers E1-2, E2-3 & E4 are now dual port RAM.\r\n- I removed D5 to D7 multiplexers because BG character RAM E7 is dual port.\r\n- I removed D8 to D10 multiplexers because E10-11 buffer RAM is dual port.\r\n- I removed E8/E9-10 bus isolation because of dual port E7 & E10-11.\r\n- I removed H13 mux because color RAM G13 to G14 is dual port.\r\n\r\nAdditional details\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n**Audio board MA216:**\r\n- SC01 is fake (samples) - WIP.\r\n\r\n**Ports:**\r\n\r\n- IP17-10: input port for test buttons, coins and player 1/2.\r\n- IP47-40: input port for joystick.\r\n- OP27-20: output port for sound interface\r\n- OP33-37: output port for knocker and coin meter.\r\n\r\nGame Compatibility List\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n- QBert: 100% compatible but rotation doesn't work yet.\r\n- QBert Qubes: 100% compatible, bug on rolling cube screen and dip switches inverted\r\n- Curve Ball: dip switch order is weird, no sound\r\n- Insector: 100% compatible, dip switch, controller inverted, problem with test mode\r\n- Mad Planets: 100% compatible but blinking letters\r\n- Tyls: 100% compatible - dip switches inverted\r\n- Three stooges: ?\r\n\r\nBugs & WIP\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- NVRAM (C5/C6) WIP\r\n- MRA files. WIP\r\n- Problem with horizontal position register E1-2. When a new object is falling from the top of the screen (ball), it appears briefly at the bottom of the screen. WIP\r\n- High Scores screen: the big three letters of player's name are not displayed correctly. It works well after a few resets (is it a problem with bus sharing logic which sends zeros to simulate high impedance for ORing outputs?).\r\n- Votrax chip is cruelly missing, QBert needs his @!#?@! voice!!! WIP (fake Votrax)\r\n- QBert Qubes: the rolling cube screen has a bug (timing?). WIP\r\n\r\n",
